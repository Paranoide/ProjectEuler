 * The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes
 * and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For
 * example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these
 * four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with
 * this property.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
 * concatenate to produce another prime.
